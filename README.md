# OpenAssessIt Markdown Templates

These are custom templates meant to be used with [OpenAssessIt](https://github.com/OpenAssessItToolkit/openassessit). 

These templates exist to augment the default text provided from Lighthouse. They are optional. Currently, most of the efforts are focused on accessibility audits.

If you run the capture.py script from the OpenAssessIt main project it will generate images of offending elements and automatically populate the Markdown files that are generated through these templates.


__The templates can be used as-is or as examples for you to create your own.__

_They are opinionated._ The template's advice is pretty general, but they are written to help me collaborate with vendors to remediate websites. Your audiences capabilities might be higher or lower than mine. You might disagree with the advice. That's cool! Feel free to create your own.

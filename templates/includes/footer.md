This accessibility assessment was generated from a [Chrome Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) report. The Accessibility portion of Chrome Lighthouse is largely sourced from [Deque's Axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) engine.

Thorough testing should also include testing with the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation tool](http://wave.webaim.org/).

Accessibility testing also requires a human to determine the validity and seriousness of an issue. Automated tests like this only catch about 40% of accessibility issues. For example, automated tests cannot tell if a menu is keyboard accessible. Please follow the checklist of manual items that require a human to test. 

You can re-run this report yourself using the open-source [OpenAssessIt project](https://github.com/OpenAssessItToolkit/openassessit) on GitHub.

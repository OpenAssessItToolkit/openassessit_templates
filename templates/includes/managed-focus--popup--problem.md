### Popups do not announce themselves or shift cursor focus to the activated popup modal.

If a keyboard user activates the popup, they cannot close the popup. The only way for a keyboard user to recover from that error is to reload the page. Screen readers will not know they activated a popup window and since its focus does not travel to the popup it will cause confusion or render the page useless.

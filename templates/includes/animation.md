## The Carousel is not keyboard or screen reader accessible [WCAG 2.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html)


### Rotating banner images

For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it.

Providing content that stops blinking after five seconds or providing a mechanism for users to stop blinking content allows people with certain disabilities to interact with the Web page, like chronic migraines, traumatic brain injury, intellectual disabilities, and people with attention deficit disorders.

#### Suggested solution:

Add a pause button to allow users to stop the animation.  Hopefully this is an option that just needs enabled in the Plugin.
